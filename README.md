# 10Commandments
A .NET Core console application to check whether a file complies with the 10 commandments.

The 10 commandments are the internal coding conventions in the HEIA-FR's Concurrent Programming class. They can be found [here](https://concurp1-1920.github.io/Organization/commandments).

# Download
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Arko109/10Commandments/releases).

# Usage
On Windows, you can simply run the executable. Or, you can launch it via command line:
```powershell
> .\10Commandmets.exe [path to file]
```
On macOS/Linux, you have to run through a terminal:
```bash
$ ./10Commandmets [path to file]
```
If you do not provide a path, or the path is invalid, the program will ask you again.
